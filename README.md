soundcloud-soundmanager-player
==============================

A completely custom, evented SoundCloud player that uses SoundManager2 to handle audio. Completely decoupled from your HTML/CSS to just handle audio/playlists/tracks, but has events that are easy to hook into. Also includes a waveform module that is loosely coupled to your HTML.
